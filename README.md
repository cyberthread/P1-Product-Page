# Advanced Project 1: Product Page

Imagine you are creating an individual product page for a greeting card on a website that sells physical greeting cards. What would a potential customer be looking for or need to know before making a purchase?

A [product page is a typical UI pattern](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/ProductPage), so there is a lot to learn from existing pages. Preliminary work might include surveying a number of product pages or even user testing them to get a feel for what customers need, want and expect.
What can you do to elevate the product page to be unique and interesting to your brand concept?
